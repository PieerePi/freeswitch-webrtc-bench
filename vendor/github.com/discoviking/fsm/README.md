A simple but powerful golang FSM library.

Originally developed for use in the Gossip SIP stack (see [here](https://github.com/StefanKopieczek/gossip/blob/master/transaction/client.go) for an example), but can be used for anything.

For full package documentation, see [the GoDoc page](https://godoc.org/github.com/DiscoViking/fsm).
